# Human-Motion-Prediction
Human motion state estimation from IMU signals using the UCI HAR dataset.  Comparison of Extended Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, and a simple RNN baseline  for one-step-ahead prediction and filtering. Includes experiments on robustness  to noise, drift, and measurement dropouts.
